# German STSbenchmark Dataset
This is the German translation of the [STSbenchmark dataset](https://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark).

It can be used to train German [sentence embeddings](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) like [T-Systems-onsite/bert-german-dbmdz-uncased-sentence-stsb](https://huggingface.co/T-Systems-onsite/bert-german-dbmdz-uncased-sentence-stsb).

## Different Translations
One translation has been done with [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/), the other with [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/). They can be combined to get some more variation in the data.
